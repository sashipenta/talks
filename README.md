# IoT Talks by Sashi Penta

# Internet of Things Lecture (OMSI After Dark, April 2015, Portland, OR.)
Internet of Things is the future. Many devices will be smart devices. 
You may want to control your garage door, light, fan, etc with your smart phone. 
How will your smart phone connect to your garage door? 
In this talk, Sashi Penta will present how IOT framework(s) can help connecting smart devices.

# OCF/IoTivity base framework (Collaboration Summit, Feb 2015, Santa Rosa, CA.) 

IoTivity, a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project that aims to implement the specification from the Open Interconnect Consortium, already supports a variety of operating systems, like Linux (regular variants as well as Tizen and Android) and Arduino, aiming to increase that number later. This presentation will focus on the base framework of IoTivity and will focus on how it has implemented its functionality on those operating systems. It will do that by showing examples of code. At the end, the presenter will show how different systems can connect and talk to each other via the OIC protocol as implemented by IoTivity.
